# AI Agent API Instructions - EDU Platform Backend API

## Base URL

`https://eduhub-platform-api-e6dyfphzcbawa9ge.canadacentral-01.azurewebsites.net`

## ðŸ¤– AI Agent Optimization

**This API is optimized for AI agents** with static URLs and clear parameter schemas. All endpoints use either:

- **Static URLs** with no placeholders
- **Query parameters** (`?param=value`)
- **Request body parameters** (JSON)

**No URL path parameters** with `{}` placeholders that cause issues for AI agents.

---

## Database Structure Overview

### Collections:

1. **Courses**: Store course information with embedded student enrollment data
2. **Enrollments**: Individual enrollment records (for detailed tracking)
3. **Students**: Student profiles with their enrolled courses
4. **Users**: User authentication and profile data

### Course Data Structure:

- `maxStudents`: Maximum allowed students
- `currentEnrollments`: Current count of enrolled students
- `enrolledStudents`: Array with student names and UIDs directly in course

---

## Available Endpoints

### 1. Health Check Endpoint

**URL**: `/health`  
**Method**: GET  
**Purpose**: Basic connectivity and service health verification

#### When to Use:

- âœ… **First call** in any workflow to verify service availability
- âœ… Before making any complex operations
- âœ… Troubleshooting connectivity issues
- âœ… Simple "is the service running?" checks

#### Decision Logic:

```
IF starting any workflow THEN call /health first
IF other endpoints fail THEN call /health to verify service status
IF need to check basic connectivity THEN use /health
```

#### No Parameters Required:

```json
{}
```

#### Expected Response:

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-16T04:07:56.179Z"
}
```

---

### 2. Get All Courses Endpoint

**URL**: `/api/courses`  
**Method**: GET  
**Purpose**: Retrieve complete course catalog with enrollment information

#### When to Use:

- âœ… **Before creating courses** to avoid duplicates
- âœ… **Before enrolling students** to get course IDs and check capacity
- âœ… Displaying course listings to users
- âœ… Checking database read operations
- âœ… Getting course IDs for enrollment operations

#### Decision Logic:

```
IF need to see available courses THEN call GET /api/courses
IF need course ID for enrollment THEN call GET /api/courses first
IF want to check enrollment capacity THEN call GET /api/courses
IF creating courses THEN call GET /api/courses first to avoid duplicates
```

#### No Parameters Required:

```json
{}
```

#### Expected Response:

```json

## Comprehensive Decision Tree

### **Starting Any Workflow:**

```
1. Call GET /health (verify service)
2. IF health OK THEN proceed with workflow
3. IF health fails THEN stop and report connectivity issue
```

### **Course Management Workflow:**

```
1. GET /health (verify service)
2. GET /api/courses (check existing courses)
3. IF need new course THEN POST /api/courses
4. IF need to see course details THEN use course data from GET response
```

### **Student Enrollment Workflow:**

```
1. GET /health (verify service)
2. GET /api/courses (find target course and check capacity)
3. IF course exists AND has capacity THEN POST /api/courses/enroll
4. GET /api/courses/students?courseId=X (verify enrollment)
5. GET /api/students/profile?studentId=X (verify student document created)
```

### **Data Verification Workflow:**

```
1. GET /health (verify service)
2. GET /api/courses (check course data integrity)
3. GET /api/students (check student data integrity)
4. For each course: GET /api/courses/students?courseId=X (verify enrollments)
```

### **Testing Database Operations:**

```
1. GET /health (verify service)
2. GET /api/courses (test read operations)
3. POST /api/courses (test write operations)
4. POST /api/courses/enroll (test complex operations)
5. GET /api/students (verify cross-collection updates)
```

## Error Handling Guide

### **400 Bad Request:**

- **Cause**: Missing required fields, invalid data types, validation errors
- **Action**: Check request body against parameter schema
- **Common Issues**: Invalid email format, missing required fields, wrong data types

### **404 Not Found:**

- **Cause**: Course ID doesn't exist, student ID doesn't exist
- **Action**: Call GET /api/courses to verify course exists
- **Next Step**: Use valid ID from course listing

### **500 Internal Server Error:**

- **Cause**: Database connectivity issues, server errors
- **Action**: Call GET /health to verify service status
- **Next Step**: If health fails, wait and retry; if health OK, check request format

---

## Best Practices for AI Agents

### **Always Follow This Order:**

1. **Health Check First**: Every workflow starts with GET /health
2. **Read Before Write**: Call GET endpoints before POST operations
3. **Verify Results**: Call GET endpoints after POST operations to confirm success
4. **Save Important IDs**: Store courseId and studentId for subsequent operations

### **Data Integrity Practices:**

1. **Check Course Capacity**: Verify currentEnrollments < maxStudents before enrollment
2. **Use Meaningful Data**: Create courses with realistic titles and descriptions
3. **Unique Identifiers**: Use unique studentId values to avoid conflicts
4. **Track Operations**: Store operation results for debugging and verification

### **AI Agent Workflow Patterns:**

#### **Simple Testing:**

```
GET /health â†’ GET /api/courses â†’ POST /api/courses â†’ GET /api/courses
```

#### **Complete Enrollment Test:**

```
GET /health â†’ GET /api/courses â†’ POST /api/courses â†’
POST /api/courses/enroll â†’ GET /api/courses/students?courseId=X â†’
GET /api/students
```

#### **Data Verification:**

```
GET /health â†’ GET /api/courses â†’ GET /api/students â†’
GET /api/students/profile?studentId=X â†’ GET /api/courses/students?courseId=X
```

## ðŸŽ¯ AI Agent Quick Reference

### **Static URLs (No placeholders):**

âœ… `/health`  
âœ… `/api/courses`  
âœ… `/api/students`  
âœ… `/api/courses/enroll`

### **Query Parameter URLs:**

âœ… `/api/courses/students?courseId=COURSE_ID`  
âœ… `/api/students/profile?studentId=STUDENT_ID`

### **Parameter Types for AI Agents:**

- **No Parameters**: Health check, get all courses, get all students
- **Request Body**: Course creation, student enrollment
- **Query Parameters**: Get course students, get student by ID

### **Common Parameter Values:**

- **Course IDs**: `course-123`, `course-456` (from course creation responses)
- **Student IDs**: `student-001`, `student-789` (unique identifiers you create)
- **Emails**: Must be valid format (e.g., `student@example.com`)

---

## Database Integration Notes

- **Enrollment creates/updates 3 collections**: Course (enrolledStudents array), Enrollments (individual records), Students (profile with enrolled courses)
- **Course capacity tracking**: Both currentEnrollments count and enrolledStudents array are maintained
- **Student profiles**: Automatically created during first enrollment, updated for subsequent enrollments
- **Data consistency**: All related documents are updated atomically during enrollment operations

The API uses Azure Cosmos DB for data persistence and supports CORS for web browser access. All POST requests require proper JSON formatting and Content-Type headers.

All endpoints are optimized for AI agents with static URLs, clear parameter schemas, and comprehensive error handling.
